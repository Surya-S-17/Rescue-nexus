# Rescue Nexus â€“ Real-Time Ambulance Alerts

**Rescue Nexus** is an intelligent system designed to improve emergency response by providing real-time ambulance tracking and alert notifications to nearby vehicles and pedestrians. It leverages VANET and MANET technologies along with a React-based app to enhance road safety and reduce ambulance response times.

## Features

- **VANET-based Vehicle Alerts:** Notifies vehicles within 1 km radius about approaching ambulances using Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET).
- **MANET-based Pedestrian Alerts:** Sends real-time alerts to pedestrians via a React mobile app using Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET).
- **Collision Detection & Fast Response:** Implements collision detection mechanisms to improve ambulance navigation and safety.

## Technologies Used

- VANET & MANET communication protocols
- React for pedestrian alert application
- Real-time location tracking
- RF communication for vehicle alerting
